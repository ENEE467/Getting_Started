Welcome to ENEE467!
===================

The course is organized in two parts. The first part uses the TI Maze Runner
robot. It exemplifies the programming and testing of low-power computer-driven
devices. Such devices are ubiquitous. There are hundreds of them operating in
our homes, offices, and cars.

The minicomputer in the TI robot does not have a built in operating system or
complier. To program it you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
This is provided by Texas Instruments in the form of Code Composer Studio, which
includes a C/C++ compiler, a source code editor, a project build environment, a
debugger, and a profiler.

The second part of the course uses the UR3e robotic arm. This is an example of
the other robotic extreme. It is controlled by a desk or laptop computer. Energy
for the operation of the computer and the arm comes right from the power plug in
the wall. You will need a Linux Machine for this Lab. The lab will help me
familiarize yourselves with simulating and moving the manipulator for defined
trajectories and to calibrate a camera.

We will use GitHub for most of the work on the robot arm
(Universal Robots UR3e). Thus, the first step in working on the UR3e is to
join GitHub. For instructions on setting up your GitHub account, please go to
https://docs.github.com/en

Once you have GitHub installed and you are reading this, please follow the
instructions below.
