Lab Exercises with the UR3e Cobot
=================================

This part of the course uses the UR3e robotic arm. This is an example of the other robotic extreme.
It is controlled by a desktop or laptop computer. Energy for the operation of the computer and the
arm comes right from the power plug in the wall. The lab
will help me familiarize yourselves with simulating and moving the manipulator for defined
trajectories and to calibrate a camera.

Throughout this part of the course, you will use a collection of tools that we have provided. These
include Docker containers, ROS2, MoveIt!, and Gazebo. The basics of these tools are explained in the
lectures. These tools are already loaded on the lab computers.
