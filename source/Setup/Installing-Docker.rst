Installing Docker
=================

Please note that Docker is distributed in two ways: Docker Desktop
(Backend + GUI) and Docker Engine (Just the backend with CLI). Docker Engine is
required for this course.

Follow the `instructions <Docker Engine Install_>`_ from Docker
documentation to install Docker Engine.

.. note::

   Make sure to manage Docker as a non-root user by following
   `this <Docker Manage Non-Root_>`_ post-installation step too.
