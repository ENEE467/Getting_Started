Additional Setup
================

Additional tools/software that are required in the host environment.

Install Git
^^^^^^^^^^^
All of the course material is available on GitHub and requires Git installed on
the host machine to fetch the course material.

Using APT package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

  apt-get install git

Text Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^
If there's no prior preference for a text editor or looking for a starting
point, we recommend using `Visual Studio Code <VSCode Download Link_>`_. Lab
exercises leverage VSCode workspace with extensions for the coding
environment.
